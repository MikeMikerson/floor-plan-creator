# Work Summary

## Project Initialization & Base Scaffold
- Generated a new Vite + React 18 project and renamed package metadata to `floor-plan-helper`.
- Replaced the default starter UI with a MoveWise-themed shell (`src/App.jsx`, `src/App.css`, `src/index.css`) covering timeline, furniture inventory, layout designer, and sharing panels.
- Added feature-specific components for the move timeline, furniture inventory, layout setup, and export placeholder with consistent styling.
- Documented outstanding work in `TASKS.md` and refreshed the repo README to describe the prototype and workflows.

## Home Layout Designer Implementation
- Built an interactive SVG canvas that supports floor-plan upload, scaling, drag/drop furniture placement, rotation, collision highlighting, zoom/pan, autosave, undo/redo, and reset flows.
- Established a reducer-driven layout state machine in `src/App.jsx` with localStorage persistence and history stacks.
- Expanded styling to accommodate the designerâ€™s three-column layout, canvas interactions, inspector, and responsive behavior.
- Updated README highlights and checked off completed designer tasks.

## Raster-to-Vector Floor Plan Conversion
- Integrated the `imagetracerjs` library to convert uploaded floor-plan images into SVG fragments that can be toggled, selected, dragged, reset, or removed.
- Extended layout state and inspector controls to manage vector fragments alongside furniture placements.
- Added new UI affordances (vectorize button, overlay toggle, legend updates, error messaging) and recorded the milestone in README/TASKS.

## Tooling & Verification
- Ensured lint (`npm run lint`) and build (`npm run build`) succeed after each major change set.
- Kept documentation (README/TASKS) aligned with delivered functionality throughout the work.
